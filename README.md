## WHMCS 5.2+ Affiliate Coupons 2.0
Author: Myles McNamara (get@smyl.es)

Based off of Affiliate Coupons 1.2 by Frank Laszlo (frank@asmallorange.com)

### Description

This module will allow coupon codes to be used instead of affiliate URLs
for granting referrals to your affiliates. This is handy for affiliates who
advertise "offline," where it is much easier to give someone a coupon code
rather than a long URL string for your referral. The coupons will also grant
the user a discount that can be defined by the administrator.


### Installation

See INSTALL file.


### License

GNU GPL 3+
See LICENSE file.


### Instructions:

Once installed, you will need to setup your coupon parameters using the admin interface
located in Utilities -> Addon Modules -> Affiliate Coupons. Once this has been configured,
affiliates will be able to add new coupon codes within their affiliate client area.
